<p><b>Yoked</b> is an Android App I developed with the goal being to eliminate the need for me to carry workout log/spreedsheets with me to the gym and instead have everything captured on my phone.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This app contains dozens of popular and frequently used workout routines built-in.</li> 
  <li>It allows users to log their workouts and also review them at a later date.</li>
  <li>During a workout, the user may access useful tools such as weight and percentage calculators.</li>
  <li>Uses Parse.com as a backend service which enables the app to retrieve and update table data with ease.</li>
  </ul>
